transport:
  car:
    petrol: 2.31  # kg CO2 per liter of petrol burned (typical value from fuel combustion; EIA standard)
    diesel: 2.68  # kg CO2 per liter of diesel burned (higher due to carbon density)
  bus:
    diesel: 2.68    # Assumes standard diesel bus; same factor as diesel cars
    biofuel: 0.00   # Assumed net-zero emissions for biofuel under ideal sustainable sourcing
    electric: 0.05  # kg CO2 per kWh of electricity consumed by electric buses (based on EU avg grid)
  train:
    electric: 0.01  # kg CO2 per kWh per person for electric trains (efficient and green in most of EU)
    diesel: 0.06    # kg CO2 per liter per person for diesel trains (efficient compared to cars)
  flight:
    short: 300     # kg CO2 per passenger-trip (< 3 hours). Includes radiative forcing index.
    medium: 800    # kg CO2 per passenger-trip (3â€“6 hours)
    long: 1600     # kg CO2 per passenger-trip (> 6 hours). Accounts for increased emissions at altitude.

diet:
  high_meat: 7.2       # kg CO2e per person per day; heavy red meat consumption (e.g. beef, lamb)
  average: 5.6         # Mixed diet with moderate meat/dairy
  vegetarian: 3.8      # No meat, some dairy/eggs
  vegan: 2.9           # No animal products

energy:
  kwh_electricity: 0.02   # kg CO2 per kWh - European average (hydro/nuclear/renewables mix)
  kwh_oil: 0.267          # kg CO2 per kWh - heating oil or similar fuel
  kwh_gas: 0.25           # kg CO2 per kWh - natural gas (methane) combustion
  kwh_wood: 0.018         # kg CO2 per kWh - biomass wood fuel (assuming sustainable forestry)
